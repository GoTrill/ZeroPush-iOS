Purpose:
--------

ZeroPush-iOS is a lightweight Obj-C wrapper around the [ZeroPush](http://zeropush.com) API. It provides some convenience methods to help you get up an running with ZeroPush as quickly as possible.

Building/Linking/Adding to your project:
----------

Eventually ZeroPush-iOS will be CocoaPod ready, but for now it should be included as source with your iOS project.

Dependencies:
-----------------

ZeroPush-iOS depends on

NSData+FormEncoding.h and Seriously.h

from [ADiOSUtilities](https://github.com/adamvduke/ADiOSUtilities) and [seriously](https://github.com/probablycorey/seriously) respectively

A more comprehensive guide to getting the dependencies squared away is coming soon.
